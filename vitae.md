## <center><u> Professional Experience </u></center>

### Aug 2014 – May 2020
<b>Brown University</b> <br>
Conducted particle phenomenology research on 100 million samples of astrophysics data with Bayesian 
and Markov-chain Monte-Carlo methods using SQL and Python. Simulated and analyzed a billion samples 
of particle physics data of a size of several TBs using C++.

### Aug 2012 – May 2014 
<b>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</b> <br>
Developed a data acquisition firmware for a field programmable gate array to process sensing microchips 
data at a time-scale of 10 nanoseconds, using VHDL and Verilog as firmware languages.

### Aug 2010 – May 2014 
<b>Chinese University of Hong Kong</b> <br>
Constructed a muon telescope by programming hardware control using C. Coded a back-end C++ program for 
data cleaning and signal detection on time series data of the muon telescope’s pixels.

### Aug 2011 – May 2012
<b>Chinese University of Hong Kong</b> <br>
Investigated quantum bouncing ball and demonstrated construction of arbitrary quantum states with Rabi oscillations.
Simulated the system using Mathematica.

### May 2011 – Aug 2011
<b>European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</b> <br>
Became the one of the first two students representing Hong Kong to participate in research in CERN. 
Mechanically and electronically assembled of CMS Cathode Strip Chambers in ME4/2 site.
