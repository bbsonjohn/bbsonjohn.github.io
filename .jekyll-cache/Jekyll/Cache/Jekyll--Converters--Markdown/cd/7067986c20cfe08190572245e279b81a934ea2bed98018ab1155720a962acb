<p><b>Brown University</b>
Conducted particle phenomenology research on 100 million samples of astrophysics data with Bayesian and Markov-chain Monte-Carlo methods using SQL and Python. Simulated and analyzed a billion samples of particle physics data of a size of several TBs using C++.
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Aug 2012 â€“ May 2014 Developed a data acquisition firmware for a field programmable gate array to process sensing microchips data at a time-scale of 10 nanoseconds, using VHDL and Verilog as firmware languages.
Chinese University of Hong Kong Aug 2010 â€“ May 2014 Constructed a muon telescope by programming hardware control using C. Coded a back-end C++ program for data cleaning and signal detection on time series data of the muon telescopeâ€™s pixels.
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) May 2011 â€“ Aug 2011 Became the one of the first two students representing Hong Kong to participate in research in CERN.</p>
