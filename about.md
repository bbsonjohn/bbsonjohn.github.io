I am a physicist, graduated with a Ph.D. in physics from Brown University. 
My expertise is in theory modeling, data analysis and hypothesis testing. 
I have experience in mathematical derivations, statistical analyses, 
working with big data, and programming. 
I am interested in applying my skills to find solutions in a business setting.
