Hi, I am Martin Kwok. 

Outside of Physics, I enjoy sports in general, in particular, badminton and bouldering.
I often have some interesting thoughts on the physics of badminton and bouldering,
so I will occasionally shares my thoughts here as well.

Here's my github page: [GitHub](https://github.com/kakwok)
